        With this free and open-source tool, you can effortlessly capture your
        screen, webcam, and microphone. Whether you need to create tutorials,
        showcase presentations, or simply share your thoughts, this app has got
        you covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin, hit the “Start Recording” button and grant your browser
        permission to access your microphone and screen. Once they're selected,
        a countdown will begin and the app will start capturing high-quality
        video and audio simultaneously, but separately. This separation allows
        for greater flexibility when it comes to downloading and editing your
        recordings.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing your recording, you'll have the option to preview both
        the video and audio tracks (individually or synchronously). If
        everything looks good, you can either download them individually or
        conveniently merge them into a single file. The choice is yours!
      </p>
      <p>
        No need to worry about creating an account, complicated setups, or
        hidden costs. Simply enjoy the seamless experience of recording,
        previewing, and downloading your recordings with ease.
